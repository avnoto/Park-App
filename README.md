## Future Development

We plan on adding geolocation and directions features to make the app more streamline. Users will be able to search for a park nearby and get directions (walking or driving), as well as removing the Sacramento restriction.

## User Story

AS A local of Sacramento, I WANT TO know where parks are in my area SO THAT I can get specific information about the park before I visit to fit my wants/needs.

Why we created this app:

Given the COVID-19 pandemic occurence, many individuals and families are looking for things to do outside their home to maintain physical and mental wellness while staying safe. Parks are a perfect opportunity for people to be outside, since they are still open to the public. The app provides a COVID-19 notice with tips on how people can stay healthy when going outside and being in a public place like a park.
